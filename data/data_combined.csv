Such shields , whether composed of matter or energy , are typically able to block most or all attacks from weapons comparable in size to the shield , i.e. personal shields are typically impenetrable by personal weapons but not to larger vehicle or ship weapons , while the shields used by mobile suits in the various Gundam anime can block mobile suit weapons and tank guns and some battleship weapons ; because of their limited coverage , however , shields are generally depicted as ineffective against area-affecting attacks like grenades and other explosives , and of limited or no use when attacked by surprise or from multiple directions .",Shields were used even after gunpowder weapons .
