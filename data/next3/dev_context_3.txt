Emphysema is called an obstructive lung disease because the destruction of lung tissue around smaller sacs , called alveoli , makes these air sacs unable to hold their functional shape upon exhalation . It occurs when the very small air sacs -LRB- called the alveoli -RRB- at the ends of the airways in the lungs start to break down from many sacs to form much bigger sacs . The alveoli are the areas of the lung where oxygen and carbon dioxide [MASK] [MASK] [MASK] [MASK] [MASK] [MASK] [MASK] [MASK] .

Today scurvy is known to be caused by a nutritional deficiency , but until the isolation of vitamin C and its direct link to scurvy in 1932 , numerous theories and treatments were proposed , often on little or no experimental data . This inconsistency is attributed to the lack of vitamin C as a distinct concept , the varying vitamin C content of different foods -LRB- notably present in fresh citrus , watercress , and organ meat -RRB- , and how vitamin C can be destroyed by exposure to air and copper .

Ant-mimicking spiders face several challenges : they generally develop slimmer abdomens and false `` waists '' in the cephalothorax to mimic the three distinct regions -LRB- tagmata -RRB- of an ant 's body ; they wave the first pair of legs in form to their heads to mimic antennae , which spiders lack , and to conceal the fact that they have eight legs rather than six ; they develop large color patches round one pair of eyes to disguise the fact that they generally have eight simple eyes , while ants have two compound eyes ; they cover their bodies with reflective hairs to resemble the shiny bodies of ants .

Antisense oligodeoxynucleotides have been proposed as possible treatment by down-regulating the expression of the oncogenic fusion protein associated with the development of Ewing sarcoma resulting from the EWS-ETS gene translocation . In addition , the synthetic retinoid derivative fenretinide -LRB- 4-hydroxy -LRB- phenyl -RRB- retinamide -RRB- has been reported to induce high levels of cell death in Ewing sarcoma cell lines in vitro and to delay growth of Ewing sarcoma xenografts in vivo mouse models .

Evolutionary developmental biology -LRB- evolution of development or informally , evo-devo -RRB- is a field of biology that compares the developmental processes of different organisms to determine the ancestral relationship between them , and to discover how developmental processes evolved . It addresses the origin and evolution of embryonic development ; how modifications of development and developmental processes lead to the production of novel features , such as the evolution of feathers ; the role of developmental plasticity in evolution ; how ecology impacts in development and evolutionary change ; and the developmental basis of homoplasy and homology .
