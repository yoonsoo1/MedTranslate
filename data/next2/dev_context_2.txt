Ant-mimicking spiders face several challenges : they generally develop slimmer abdomens and false `` waists '' in the cephalothorax to mimic the three distinct regions -LRB- tagmata -RRB- of an ant 's body ; they wave the first pair of legs in form to their heads to mimic antennae , which spiders lack , and to conceal the fact that they have eight legs rather than six ; they develop large color patches round one pair of eyes to disguise the fact that they generally have eight simple eyes , while ants have two compound eyes ; they cover their bodies with reflective hairs to resemble the shiny bodies of ants .

Evolutionary developmental biology -LRB- evolution of development or informally , evo-devo -RRB- is a field of biology that compares the developmental processes of different organisms to determine the ancestral relationship between them , and to discover how developmental processes evolved . It addresses the origin and evolution of embryonic development ; how modifications of development and developmental processes lead to the production of novel features , such as the evolution of feathers ; the role of developmental plasticity in evolution ; how ecology impacts in development and evolutionary change ; and the developmental basis of homoplasy and homology .

In 1772 Jean-Andr Ã Deluc studied the several substances then used in thermometers in the light of new theories of heat and came to the conclusion that mercurial thermometers were the best for practical use ; for example , if two equal amounts of water at x and y degrees were mixed , the temperature of the result was then the average of x and y degrees , and this relationship only held reliably when mercury was used .
