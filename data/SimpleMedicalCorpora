Cancer	14	With the use of computers , the unit was the first to bring together large amounts of cancer data .
Cancer	12	They in turn were made up of millions of cells . This laid rest the humor-theories about chemical imbalances in the body .
Cancer	15	They said that diseased bone marrow could also be destroyed with radiation . This led to the discovery of bone marrow transplants for leukemia .
