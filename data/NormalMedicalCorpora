Transposon	18	In vertebrate animal cells nearly all -RRB- 100,000 DNA transposons per genome have genes that encode inactive transposase polypeptides .
Transposon	2	Transposons themselves are assigned to one of two classes according to their mechanism of transposition , which can be described as either `` copy and paste '' -LRB- class I -RRB- or `` cut and paste '' -LRB- class II -RRB- .
Transposon	17	Bacteria may undergo high rates of gene deletion as part of a mechanism to remove transposons and viruses from their genomes while eukaryotic organisms use RNA interference -LRB- RNAi -RRB- to inhibit transposon activity .
Transposon	16	Various viruses and transposons also share features in their genome structures and biochemical abilities , leading to speculation that they share a common ancestor .

Transposon	0	Transposition can create phenotypically significant mutations and alter the cell 's genome size .
Eye	21	Ocelli -LRB- pit-type eyes of arthropods -RRB- blur the image across the whole retina , and are consequently excellent at responding to rapid changes in light intensity across the whole visual field ; this fast response is further accelerated by the large nerve bundles which rush the information to the brain .
Eye	21	Focusing the image would also cause the sun 's image to be focused on a few receptors , with the possibility of damage under the intense light ; shielding the receptors would block out some light and thus reduce their sensitivity .
Eye	18	The resolution of pit eyes can be greatly improved by incorporating a material with a higher refractive index to form a lens , which may greatly reduce the blur radius encounteredâ '' hence increasing the resolution obtainable .
Eye	21	The ocelli of insects bear a simple lens , but their focal point always lies behind the retina ; consequently they can never form a sharp image .
Eye	36	Good fliers like flies or honey bees , or prey-catching insects like praying mantis or dragonflies , have specialized zones of ommatidia organized into a fovea area which gives acute vision .

Hot chocolate	15	In the United Kingdom , `` hot chocolate '' is a sweet chocolate drink made with hot milk or water , and powder containing chocolate , sugar , and powdered milk .
Hot chocolate	14	Americans use the terms `` hot chocolate '' and `` hot cocoa '' interchangeably . In other places , a distinction is made between `` hot cocoa '' , made from powder made by removing most of the rich cocoa butter from the ground cacao beans , and `` hot chocolate '' , made directly from bar chocolate , which already contains cocoa , sugar and cocoa butter .
Hot chocolate	13	This powderâ '' much like the instant cocoa powder used todayâ '' was easier to stir into milk and water , and led to another very important discovery : solid chocolate .
Hot chocolate	1	The first chocolate beverage is believed to have been created by the Mayan peoples around 2,000 years ago , and a cocoa beverage was an essential part of Aztec culture by 1400 AD .
Hot chocolate	6	What the Spaniards then called `` chocolatl '' was said to be a beverage consisting of a chocolate base flavored with vanilla and other spices that was served cold .
Hot chocolate	14	Thus the major difference between the two is the cocoa butter , whose absence makes hot cocoa significantly lower in fat than hot chocolate , while still preserving all the antioxidants found in chocolate .
Hot chocolate	14	In other places , a distinction is made between `` hot cocoa '' , made from powder made by removing most of the rich cocoa butter from the ground cacao beans , and `` hot chocolate '' , made directly from bar chocolate , which already contains cocoa , sugar and cocoa butter .
Hot chocolate	17	It is very sweet and may be topped with marshmallows , whipped cream , or a piece of solid chocolate .
Hot chocolate	9	After defeating Montezuma 's warriors , and demanding that the Aztec nobles hand over their valuables , CortÃ s returned to Spain in 1528 , bringing cocoa beans and chocolate drink making equipment .
Hot chocolate	13	By using cocoa powder and low amounts of cocoa butter , bar chocolate was then possible to manufacture . The term `` chocolate '' then came to mean solid chocolate , rather than hot chocolate .
Hot chocolate	5	It was often seasoned with vanilla , chile pepper , and achiote , and was believed to fight fatigue , which is probably attributable to the theobromine content , a mood enhancer .
Hot chocolate	15	American instant hot cocoa powder often includes powdered milk or other dairy ingredients so it can be made without using milk .
Hot chocolate	7	Because sugar was yet to come to the Americas , xocolatl was said to be an acquired taste .

Pulmonary hypertension	15	In hypoxic pulmonary hypertension -LRB- WHO Group III -RRB- , the low levels of oxygen are thought to cause vasoconstriction or tightening of pulmonary arteries . This leads to a similar pathophysiology as pulmonary arterial hypertension .
Pulmonary hypertension	14	Instead , the left heart fails to pump blood efficiently , leading to pooling of blood in the lungs .
Pulmonary hypertension	13	Therefore it becomes harder and harder for the left side of the heart to pump to supply sufficient oxygen to the rest of the body , especially during physical activity .
The Mighty Boosh	1	Fielding first met Barratt after seeing him perform his solo stand-up routine at the Hellfire Comedy Club in the Wycombe Swan theater .
Tonsil	2	Like other organs of the lymphatic system , some believe them to be involved in helping fight off pharyngeal and upper respiratory tract infections , but there is no conclusive evidence to that effect .
Tonsil	1	The human palatine tonsils and the nasopharyngeal tonsil are lymphoepithelial tissues located near the oropharynx and nasopharynx , although most commonly the term `` tonsils '' refers to the palatine tonsils -LRB- that can be seen in the back of the throat -RRB- .
Tonsil	3	An inflammation of the tonsils is called tonsillitis , which causes one 's tonsils to become sore and swollen .
Tetanospasmin	0	Tetanus toxin is the neurotoxin produced by the vegetative cell of Clostridium tetani in anaerobic conditions , causing tetanus .
Lymphatic system	11	Lymph nodes are located at intervals along the lymphatic system . Several afferent lymph vessels bring in lymph , which percolates through the substance of the lymph node , and is drained out by an efferent lymph vessel .
Flood basalt	0	A flood basalt or trap basalt is the result of a giant volcanic eruption or series of eruptions that coats large stretches of land or the ocean floor with basalt lava .
Attock Tehsil	0	The eastern half consists of the tract known as the Nala , which includes , along with a number of low hills and much broken country , a considerable area of fairly good level land , portions of which are irrigated from wells and by cuts from the Haro and other smaller streams .

Game port	11	This can be overcome by using pins and input meant for the second joystick -LRB- i.e. button 5 through 8 are mapped to the signals to the axis pins meant for the second joystick - resulting in the issue of the two buttons mapped to the same axis being not simultaneously usable -RRB- , using some normally `` unused '' pins , or changing the joystick 's circuits -LRB- and related software -RRB- to read a 4-bit state code from the four button inputs , thus giving up to 16 button combinations -LRB- albeit with some limitations e.g. some buttons may not be held down -RRB- or a combination of both techniques .
Game port	3	The typical implementation of a game port uses a capacitor and a simple voltage comparator , which together form a sort of crude ramp-compare ADC , which needs to be periodically polled and reset at precise moments to read an input , something that must be done several times -LRB- generally above 30 -RRB- per second to provide a responsive game input , and the actual acquisition frequency and value typically depend on the joystick 's internal resistance , noise , CPU speed and the total joystick-capacitor 's RC time constant .
Thermal expansion	42	Thermometers are another application of thermal expansion â '' most contain a liquid -LRB- usually mercury or alcohol -RRB- which is constrained to flow in only one direction -LRB- along the tube -RRB- due to changes in volume brought about by changes in temperature .
St Albans	13	St Albans has a thriving cultural life , with regular concerts and theater productions held at venues including St Albans Abbey , Maltings Arts Theatre , the Alban Arena , the Abbey Theatre , St Peter 's Church and St Saviour 's Church , given by numerous organizations including St Albans Bach Choir , St Albans Cathedral Choir , St Albans Abbey Girl 's Choir , St Albans Symphony Orchestra , St Albans Chamber Choir , St Albans Chamber Opera , The Company of Ten , St Albans Choral Society , and St Albans Organ Theatre .
Nasal bone	1	The nasal bones are two small oblong bones , varying in size and form in different individuals ; they are placed side by side at the middle and upper part of the face , and form , by their junction , `` the bridge '' of the nose .
Dubai	5	In 1833 , following tribal feuding , the Al Maktoum dynasty -LRB- also descendants of the House of Al-Falasi -RRB- of the Bani Yas tribe left their ancestral home of the Liwa Oasis , South-west of the settlement of Abu Dhabi and quickly took over Dubai from the Abu Fasala clan without resistance .

Dyspnea	16	If the level of respiration is inappropriate for the body 's status then dyspnea might occur . It is worth noting that there is a psychological component of dyspnea as well , as some people may become aware of their breathing in such circumstances but not experience the distress typical of dyspnea .
Fat	0	Fats consist of a wide group of compounds that are generally soluble in organic solvents and largely insoluble in water .
Fumarole	0	A fumarole -LRB- Latin fumus , smoke -RRB- is an opening in a planet 's crust , often in the neighborhood of volcanoes , which emits steam and gases such as carbon dioxide , sulfur dioxide , hydrochloric acid , and hydrogen sulfide .
Howard Staunton	27	He also wrote in the Illustrated London News that he had `` been compelled , by laborious literary occupation , to abandon the practice of chess , beyond the indulgence of an occasional game ... If Mr. Morphy â '' for whose skill we entertain the liveliest admiration â '' be desirous to win his spurs among the chess chivalry of Europe , he must take advantage of his purposed visit next year ; he will then meet in this country , in France , in Germany and in Russia , many champions ... ready to test and do honor to his prowess . ''
Kingdom Hearts	18	To allow them to regain their memories , NaminÃ puts Sora , Donald , and Goofy to sleep for a year ; in the process , they must lose the memories of their experience in Castle Oblivion .
Kingdom Hearts	6	The game picks up after the events of Kingdom Hearts II , focusing this time on King Mickey , Donald , Goofy and Jiminy Cricket , who discover a mysterious sentence in Jiminy 's journal and subsequently digitize the journal 's contents to find the one responsible .
Rheumatism	0	Rheumatism or rheumatic disorder is a non-specific term for medical problems affecting the joints and connective tissue .
Joker (comics)	1	Similarly , throughout the character 's long history , there have been several different origin tales ; they most commonly depict him as falling into a tank of chemical waste , which bleaches his skin and turns his hair green and his lips bright red , giving him the appearance of a clown .
Director of Central Intelligence	2	The post of DCI was established by President Harry Truman on January 23 , 1946 , with Admiral Sidney Souers occupying the position ; it thus predates the establishment of the Central Intelligence Agency .
Arsenide	3	Metal arsenides react with acids to form highly toxic arsine gas .
Selenium	14	Industrial production of selenium often involves the extraction of selenium dioxide from residues obtained during the purification of copper . Common production begins by oxidation with sodium carbonate to produce selenium dioxide .
Selenium	18	In plants , it occurs as a bystander mineral , sometimes in toxic proportions in forage -LRB- some plants may accumulate selenium as a defense against being eaten by animals , but other plants such as locoweed require selenium , and their growth indicates the presence of selenium in soil -RRB- .
Selenium	14	The selenium dioxide is then mixed with water and the solution is acidified to form selenous acid -LRB- oxidation step -RRB- . Selenous acid is bubbled with sulfur dioxide -LRB- reduction step -RRB- to give elemental selenium .
Selenium	62	Other selenides include mercury selenide -LRB- HgSe -RRB- , lead selenide -LRB- PbSe -RRB- , and zinc selenide -LRB- ZnSe -RRB- .
Cat	52	This is because a male cat 's penis has a band of about 120 â `` 150 backwards-pointing spines , which are about one millimeter long ; upon withdrawal of the penis , the spines rake the walls of the female 's vagina , which is a trigger for ovulation .
Cat	53	After mating , the female will wash her vulva thoroughly .
Speciation	21	The low fitness of the hybrids would cause selection to favor assortative mating , which would control hybridization .
Speciation	25	Diane Dodd was also able to show how reproductive isolation can develop from mating preferences in Drosophila pseudoobscura fruit flies after only eight generations using different food types , starch and maltose .
Speciation	19	Some evidence , such as the fact that six out of thirteen allozyme loci are different , that hawthorn flies mature later in the season and take longer to mature than apple flies ; and that there is little evidence of interbreeding -LRB- researchers have documented a 4-6 % hybridization rate -RRB- suggests that sympatric speciation is occurring .
Salvador Luria	4	The idea that natural selection affects bacteria has profound consequences , for example , it explains how bacteria develop antibiotic resistance .
Salvador Luria	4	His famous experiment with DelbrÃ 1\/4 ck in 1943 , known as the Luria-Delbr Ã 1\/4 ck experiment , demonstrated statistically that inheritance in bacteria must follow Darwinian rather than Lamarckian principles and that mutant bacteria occurring randomly can still bestow viral resistance without the virus being present .
Salvador Luria	6	While investigating how a culture of E. coli was able to stop the production of phages , Luria discovered that specific bacterial strains produce enzymes that cut DNA at certain sequences .
Salvador Luria	0	Salvador Edward Luria -LRB- Turin , August 13 , 1912 -- Lexington , February 6 , 1991 -RRB- was an Italian microbiologist and a Nobel laureate -LRB- Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine -RRB- for his pioneering work with Max DelbrÃ 1\/4 ck and Alfred Hershey on phages in molecular biology .
Hand axe	10	Studies in the 1990s at Boxgrove , in which a butcher attempted to cut up a carcass with a hand axe , revealed that the hand axe was perfect for getting at the bone marrow , which is high in protein and vitamins and thus was likely highly prized as a food source .
Wilderness	3	Many new parks are currently being planned and legally passed by various Parliaments and Legislatures at the urging of dedicated individuals around the globe who believe that `` in the end , dedicated , inspired people empowered by effective legislation will ensure that the spirit and services of wilderness will thrive and permeate our society , preserving a world that we are proud to hand over to those who come after us .

Three minutes later , it was Shane McMahon 's turn to hurl Kurt Angle out of the ring and into a steel ring post .
The Invasion (professional wrestling)	30	Because of this announcement , many Alliance members began to distrust Stone Cold , looking at him with suspicious eyes , to which Stone Cold vehemently denied the charges and called Vince a liar .
The Invasion (professional wrestling)	50	Back in the ring , Austin laid a `` Stone Cold '' Stunner on to retain the belt as a disgruntled Vince scowled .
The Invasion (professional wrestling)	54	`` While it was good TV , it was n't what everyone thought the WCW vs WWF would have been all about ... When the fans of WWF and WCW reminisced about a WCW vs WWF match back in the glory days of Monday Night Wars of around 1997 , their match would have probably gone like this : WCW would probably have a team of Hollywood Hulk Hogan , Scott Hall , Kevin Nash , Goldberg , and Ric Flair against ... maybe the WWF team of Stone Cold Steve Austin , The Rock , the Undertaker , Shawn Michaels , and Mick Foley .
The Invasion (professional wrestling)	25	The WWF gained even more momentum at Unforgiven , as The Rock retained the WCW Championship in a handicap match against Booker T and Shane McMahon , and Kurt Angle made Austin submit to the ankle lock , winning the WWF Championship from Stone Cold , putting both belts into the hands of the WWF .

For example the kidney secretes endocrine hormones such as erythropoietin and renin .
Salamander	4	Some terrestrial species lack both lungs and gills and perform gas exchange through their skin , a process known as valerian respiration in which the capillary beds are spread throughout the epidermis , and inside the mouth .
Salamander	6	In the lungless salamanders , muscles surrounding the hyoid bone contract to create pressure and actually `` shoot '' the hyoid bone out of the mouth along with the tongue .
Salamander	7	Many of the highly aquatic species , however , have no muscles in the tongue , and do not use it for capturing prey , while most other species have a mobile tongue , but without the adaptations to the hyoid bone .
Salamander	5	Salamanders also secrete poison from glands in their skin , and some additionally have skin glands for secreting courtship pheromones .
Salamander	5	The skin of salamanders secretes mucus , which helps keep the animal moist when on dry land , and maintains their salt balance while in water , as well as providing a lubricant during swimming .
Salamander	6	Muscles in the pelvic region are used in order to reel the tongue and the hyoid back to its original position .

Cancer	59	Many management options for cancer exist including : chemotherapy , radiation therapy , surgery , immunotherapy , monoclonal antibody therapy and other methods .
Cancer	78	The oldest known description and surgical treatment of cancer was discovered in Egypt and dates back to approximately 1600 BC .

Cancer	77	Galen -LRB- 2nd century AD -RRB- called benign tumors oncos , Greek for swelling , reserving Hippocrates ' carcinos for malignant tumors .
Cancer	26	Similarly , physical trauma is not accepted as a cause for cervical cancer , breast cancer , or brain cancer .
Cancer	85	Modern epidemiological methods are closely linked to current concepts of disease and public health policy .
Cancer	75	This name comes from the appearance of the cut surface of a solid malignant tumor , with `` the veins stretched on all sides as the animal the crab has its feet , whence it derives its name '' .

Cancer	78	The Papyrus describes 8 cases of ulcers of the breast that were treated by cauterization , with a tool called `` the fire drill . ''
Cancer	84	The complications in communication this brought , along with the necessity of the patient 's treatment in a hospital facility rather than at home , also created a parallel process of compiling patient data into hospital files , which in turn led to the first statistical patient studies .
Cancer	78	The writing says about the disease , `` There is no treatment . ''

Cancer	86	The Japanese medical community observed that the bone marrow of victims of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki was completely destroyed .
Cancer	82	This view of the disease was first formulated by the English surgeon Campbell De Morgan between 1871 and 1874 .
Cancer	86	This insight drove national public health bodies to make it possible to compile health data across practises and hospitals , a process that many countries do today .
Cancer	85	With the use of computers , the unit was the first to compile large amounts of cancer data .
Cancer	82	During the same period , the idea that the body was made up of various tissues , that in turn were made up of millions of cells , laid rest the humor-theories about chemical imbalances in the body .
Cancer	86	They concluded that diseased bone marrow could also be destroyed with radiation , and this led to the discovery of bone marrow transplants for leukemia .
Cancer	84	When Marie Curie and Pierre Curie discovered radiation at the end of the 19th century , they stumbled upon the first effective non-surgical cancer treatment .
